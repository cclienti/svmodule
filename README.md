# SVModule

## Introduction
SVModule is set of python scripts/classes to parse a [System]Verilog module declaration and paste it as an instance,
parameter definitions... It manages module imports, parameters, standard and interface I/O ports.

The objective is to provide a similar behavior of the emacs VHDL mode but in the form of shell commands. Then it is
easy to wrap them into your preferred editor as macros or functions.
